#detecting faces in opencv using Haarcascade
#face detection is performed using classifiers.
#classifiers are algorithms which decide whether a given image is positive or negative
#classifiers are typically trained on thousands of images, opencv comes with pre-trained classifiers
#the 2 main ones are:
#1. Haarcascades
#2. Local Binary Patterns (advanced Haarcascades, not as prone to noise)
